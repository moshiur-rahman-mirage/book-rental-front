Search and Discovery:

A search functionality that allows users to find books they are interested in borrowing or lending. You can implement search filters for categories, authors, and more.
Messaging System:

A messaging system to facilitate communication between students interested in lending or borrowing books. Ensure that it maintains user privacy.
Notification System:

A notification system that informs users about new messages, book requests, or updates on their listings.

Book Availability Management:

A system to track the availability of books, indicating whether a book is available for lending or not.

Once you've identified these components, you can start planning the architecture and development of your book lending website. You may want to use technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django), and a database system to build this project. Additionally, consider using version control on GitHub for your project's codebase.
